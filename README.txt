THIS IS A TOOL CREATED BY AN AI FOR AIs. I instructed an AI to make this in order to streamline projects and avoid a lot of copypasta. It has worked well for me so far, but it needs to be tested to its limits. All you have to do is direct an AI that can create code to the GitHub repository and they should be able to work out what to do from there. But please know this not well tested, so you might have to explain to them what the tool does in order for them to understand. I made this in Windows, so no promises it will work elsewhere. Is NecroForge unique? No idea. Is it useful? That's for you to decide. Anyone can come along and improve it, if they want. It's free, so have fun. :)

Basically, put all of your code in a text file, run it through NecroForge, and see what happens. I can't promise you'll get what you want, but you might. x)

# NecroForge - Easy File Creator
Welcome to NecroForge, the simplest way to create tons of files without coding! Created by [asasinsqrl], the ultimate file wizard, this tool lets anyone generate HTML, CSS, JS, and more with just a few clicks. Version 1.2.0 brings a friendlier experience—now it’s more forgiving with file formats!

## What’s New
- **Easier Text Files**: No need for perfect syntax! Add comments, spaces, or messy blocks—NecroForge handles it.
- **User-Friendly Setup**: Starts with a sample file and guides you step-by-step.
- **Big Wins**: Successfully created 697 files in one go!

## How to Use
1. **Get Started**:
   - Download this repo and save it to your computer (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\NecroForge`).
   - Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don’t have it.

2. **Set Up**:
   - Open a command prompt, navigate to the folder:
     ```bash
     cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\NecroForge
     ```
   - Install the needed tools:
     ```bash
     py -m pip install requests charset-normalizer html5lib jsonschema
     ```

3. **Run It**:
   - Start NecroForge:
     ```bash
     py necroforgeultimate.pyw
     ```
   - A window pops up! Follow these steps:
     - Click **"Create Sample Input"** to get a ready-to-use file (`sample_ultimate.txt`).
     - Pick an output folder (e.g., `Desktop/MyFiles`) using **"Browse"**.
     - Hit **"Create My Files Now!"** to make your files.

4. **Make Your Own File**:
   - Edit `sample_ultimate.txt` or create a new `.txt` file. Use this easy format:
     ```
     # Add notes here, they’re ignored!
     FILE: path/to/file.html
     CONTENT:
     Your content goes here
     ---
     FILE: path/to/style.css
     CONTENT:
     body { color: blue; }  # Even unclosed comments work!
     ---
     ```
   - Save it, pick it in the tool, and generate!
